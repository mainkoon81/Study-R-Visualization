__Story:__ People's perception of their audience on FB matches up to the reality? 
 - Well, FB believes who you think is in your audience affects how you present yourself. 
 - Who's actually seeing the content they are sharing?  
   - __Survey Q1.__ "How many do you think saw the post? 
     - There is a big mismatch b/w people's perceived audience size and their actual audience size.
     - People dramatically underestimate the size of their audience - (1/4). 
   
__Library:__ `ggplot2`

__Data:__ 'pseudo_facebook.tsv' 

#### Adjust a font size?
 - with the font size set to 20 ?
```
install.packages('ggthemes', dependencies = TRUE)
library(ggthemes)
theme_set(theme_minimal(20)) 

pf <- read.csv('C:/Users/Minkun/Desktop/classes_1/NanoDeg/1.Data_AN/L7/---New R/data/pseudo_facebook.tsv', sep = '\t')
```

>Phase_01. Understand the audience
 - Histogram of Users' Birthdays by day
   - x-axis is the 'date of birth'
   - Adjust x-axis' bins, using 'scale' layers!...JUST marking ticks, using "1 to 31"
```
ggplot(aes(x = dob_day), data = pf) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:31)
```
 - Facetting, Splitting the data over 'months' `+ facet_wrap(~dob_month)`
```
ggplot(data = pf, aes(x = dob_day)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:31) +
  facet_wrap(~dob_month)
```
